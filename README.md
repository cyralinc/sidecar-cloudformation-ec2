# sidecar-cloudformation-ec2

> **NOTE:** This repository will not be maintained after the `v4.10` release of the Cyral sidecar.
>
> Cyral suggests migrating to one of our other supported [deployment methods](https://cyral.com/docs/sidecars/deployment) as Cloudformation support could be limited in the future.

## Summary
