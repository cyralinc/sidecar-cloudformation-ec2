# sidecar-cloudformation-ec2

> **NOTE:** This repository will not be maintained after the `v4.10` release of the Cyral sidecar.
>
> Cyral suggests migrating to one of our other supported deployment methods ([Terraform](https://cyral.com/docs/sidecars/terraform/install) or [Helm](https://cyral.com/docs/sidecars/helm3/install)) as Cloudformation support could be limited in the future.

## Summary

Customers that are running sidecar versions <= `v4.9` can use the [Cloudformation YAML](./cft_sidecar.yaml) file located in this repository to upgrade their sidecar to at least `v4.10`.
